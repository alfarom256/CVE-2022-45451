## Introduction

##### System Specs:
* Windows 10 1809 x64 EN

##### Target:
* Acronis Home Cyber Protect
* Acronis Cyber Protect

### Vulnerability Description
The Acronis "ngscan" anti-malware scan driver suffers from incorrect / improper access control placed on the filter communication port. 
The minifilter driver supports the following features that may be exploited:
* Arbitrary file read
* Sensitive Registry Key Modification (not exploited, trigger conditions unknown) which may lead to local code execution


### Arbitrary File Read
Analysis of the ngscan.sys driver began by decompiling the driver with Ida Pro. The researched noted that while a device object was created, no symlinks were created to interact with the driver using `DeviceIoControl`.
As such, analysis continued by observing the Filter Communication Port capabilities.
During initialization, the driver creates five (5) communication ports to support interaction from other processes.

Fig. 1: Routine supporting creation of up to five (5) filter communication ports (FCP)

This function was observed being called, initializing each of the 5 FCPs with a default dacl, with the last FCP being created with a NULL dacl.

Analysis continued by observing the CreateNotifyCallback and MessageNotifyCallback functions specified by the filter driver. 
These callback functions are invoked whenever a process opens a connection, and sends a message to the communication port.

Initial inspection of the MessageNotifyCallback showed that the buffer of the incoming message must meet the following requirements:
* the first DWORD must match an expected header value "TrMs" (Line 37)
* the second DWORD must contain the length of the *message contents* (note: this is different and distinct from the InputBufferLength)
* the message content length must be less than or equal to the full input buffer size minus the size of the message header 
	* The message header is composed of the header and size, and another unknown value totalling 0xC (12) bytes

Once the checks have passed, a function number is parsed from the InputBuffer and is used in the following `switch` cases to select which function to execute with the provided input.

Inspecting each of the supported functions showed two functions of interest for potential abuse leading to arbitrary file read.

Fig. 4: Functions supporting creating a scan context and returning the scan context's file handle (Lines 206, 233)

While the exact functionality of a "scan context" is not fully known, analysis showed that a file scan context may be created for any given file specified in the user InputBuffer.
Once a scan context is created, the scan context ID is returned back to the user in the output buffer.

Once a scan context was created, and the ID retrieved, a handle to the file for which the scan context was created may be opened in the requesting application by again sending a message to the communication port.

Fig. 8: Created Scan Context file handle retrieval

The function designated as `CreateFileReturnHandle0` was only called if the previous function `SearchScanContextsByID` returned a valid scan context.
E.g. only if the requesting process provided a valid context ID which was previously created by calling the aforementioned scan creation function.
The requesting program successfully opened a handle to the privileged file by providing the scan context ID to the function specified in Figure 8 (Figure 4, Line 233).

Using processhacker, access to the file handle was confirmed by viewing the requesting process' handles:

### Potential Code Injection
Further exploration of the supported functions showed the control of three registry keys which may be leveraged to gain code execution.

The circumstances for dll injection for hooking by the Acronis suite were not determined, though if hook monitoring is enabled it is believed that the dll specified by the `x64HookLib` and `x86HookLib` registry keys would be injected into a designated process.

### Race Condition Allowing Limited Arbitrary File Read
The process of opening a scan context has been pretermitted in the analysis for the Arbitrary File Read.
A process may, instead of creating a scan context, brute-force scan context IDs by repeatedly issuing requests to the `GetScanContextByID` function, looping over ContextID values until one or more valid scan contexts is found.
